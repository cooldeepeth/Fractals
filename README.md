Puzzle game to collect randomised fractional NFTs

We are developing a fractionalized NFT marketplace that turns art ownership into a puzzle game. Here's how it works:

- Artists mint their artwork as NFTs on our platform. Our smart contract splits each NFT into randomised fractional tokens.
- The fractional NFTs are listed anonymously on our marketplace. Collectors buy and trade the fractions, not knowing which famous artist they belong to.
- Collectors try to gather all the fractional NFTs to complete an artwork. Our contract automatically rewards the first collector who successfully reassembles an artwork NFT.
- By fractionalizing artwork, we make owning exclusive art more fun and accessible to regular crypto users. The platform breathes new life into NFT collecting.

Our technical approach uses Ethereum, smart contracts, and indexed database lookups to power the fractionalisation and rewards. The front end is built for smooth trading, and community engagement around the artwork mainly focused on beginner Artist/Collector.
